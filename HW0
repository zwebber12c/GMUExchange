Student Marketplace: GMUExchange. GMUExchange is a marketplace for students to connect to
exchange textbooks, notes, and other miscellaneous items such as class supplies. Verified Mason
affiliates are eligible to create an account that has full access to GMUExchange services.
Users will be connected to each other; GMUExchange will not support monetary transactions.
Users will be able to search by department, class, and professor for class related items.
Market rates for new and used textbooks will be displayed in listings, and users will be 
encouraged to post photos of the supplies they are selling to ensure quality consensus.
A review system will allow users that have been connected to rate each other and GMUExchange.
User reviews will be available on profile pages to encourage quality interactions.
